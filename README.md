# Binary Search Tree

This repository is my implementation of a binary search tree data structure in JavaScript.  It includes functions to insert values, remove nodes, search for a value, and traverse the tree in different orders (in‑order, pre‑order, and post‑order).  I built this as part of my algorithms studies and to practise recursive programming.  The code lives in a single file and includes a basic test harness to demonstrate usage.  Feel free to clone the repo, run the script, and experiment with building and balancing trees yourself.
